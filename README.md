# Computer Store Project Front-end

## Getting Started

> This is a living document, so please check back occasionally for changes.

### Repository Conventions

- Remote repository is hosted on GitHub
- `eslint` standards will be enforced

### Visual Studio Code

It would be best to use Visual Studio code so we can all use the same plugins. However, if you feel more comfortable using a different editor/IDE please do so.

> Visual Studio Code has great Git integration. If you use something else you may need to learn various Git commands - good luck!

#### Recommended Plugins

- GitLens // for github inetrgration
- Eslint // for Javascript linting
- Toggle Format on Save // for auto correct
- Babal ES6/ES7 // for writing es6 in js (get integrates with nodemon or node)
- npm Intellisense // autocompletes npm modules in import statements.
- Rainbow Brackets // for nice color for brackets, etc..
- Better Comment // for upgrading comments to Alerts, Queries, TODOs, Highlights, Strikethrough, etc...
